Welcome to the Wall. It's season 6, episode 3, and you are one of the dishonorable mutineers who preferred to see Lord Commander Snow die rather than accept Wildlings south of the Wall. To your surprise, Lord Commander Snow was resurrected last night, you are sentenced to death by hanging. However, if you can guess the secret word or phrase in seven tries, you will be allowed to live out your days north of the Wall.  

May the Old Gods be with you.
